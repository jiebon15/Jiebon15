During my free time, I actively contribute to open-source projects on GitHub. Due to my significant contributions to DuckDuckGo, I was appointed as a maintainer and community leader with write access to all of DuckDuckGo's repositories. I have also made contributions to a variety of other open-source projects and organizations, including Mozilla, Angular, Svelte, Node.JS etc
